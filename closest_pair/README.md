# Closest Pair

A program to find the closest pair of points on a plane, with a visualization tool implemented as well.

The program supports the points to be randomly generated, or decided by the user.

Two algoriths are implemented, and you can choose either one of them to find the closest pair :)

## Structure

* `./src`: source code of the program
* `./bin`
  * `./release`
    * `ClosestPair.exe`: Executable
    * Other `dll`s
  * `./report`: source code for the report

## Config

* Built with QtCreator, and Qt version 5.15
* Deployed by WindeployQt
* c++ version: c++17 or above

## Usage

* Simply run `./bin/release/ClosestPair.exe`
* See `Report.md` for further instructions
* To build by yourself, QtCreator or Visual Studio (Qt plugin installed) is suggested, and Qt version should be larger than Qt5
